    "The problem with this is that just like the average conflicts, there's no column nor any relationship in the data for the weather at all, and so we must use a difference source of data just for the weather. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since we concluded that Tunisia has the most frequent conflicts, we want to test this climate data on the country with a less frequent conflicts, but we also don't want it to be too few as then we'd have less data, and so for this, we'll use Benin; this is so that there's a big enough gap for conflicts to start between each and we could use this to correlate with the climate data.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to know that this is to correlate the weather with the start dates of the conflicts instead of during them as every day is counted as a day of conflict in our previous data to measure their lengths. This means that we have to create a new algorithm for the old data to detect the start dates of a conflict regardless if there's another conflict on those same days, meaning that we must ignore duplicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "To reduce the hassle, the new source of data for the climate is already included in the project folder as the name \"BeninClimate.csv\", the dates of for the climate data are in invalid format and is too long to be manually formatted and in order to correlate the climate data with the conflict data the dates are a requirement, and so a new csv file with only Benin's filtered climate data is created with and saved in a file named \"BeninConflicts.csv\".\n",
